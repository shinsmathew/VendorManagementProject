1) Install Radis - download Redis for windows 11 git

2) Advanced system Settings -> Environment variables -> Path -> Edit -> New -> Add new path for Redis (C:\Program Files\Redis) -> Ok

3) Command Prompt -> redis-server
                  -> redis-cli  - (start redis CLI)
                  -> KEYS *     - to get all keys
                  ->KEYS Vendor_*  - filter keys for vendor
                  -> HGETALL /GET / LRANGE / SMEMBERS <key>  : Hash, String, List, Set    ( Eg:  GET VendorApp_Vendor_9)
                  -> DEL <key>
                  -> TYPE <key> (know the datatype of Key)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. String Operations
Strings are the simplest data type and can hold text, numbers, or binary data.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SET key value: Set a string value for a key.
GET key: Get the value of a key.
DEL key: Delete a key.
INCR key: Increment the value of a key (assumes integer).
DECR key: Decrement the value of a key.
APPEND key value: Append value to the end of the existing string.
MSET key1 value1 key2 value2 ...: Set multiple keys to multiple values.
MGET key1 key2 ...: Get the values of multiple keys.
EXPIRE key seconds: Set a timeout for a key (in seconds).
TTL key: Check the remaining time to live for a key.

2. Hash Operations
Hashes store field-value pairs, similar to a dictionary.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

HSET key field value: Set the value of a field in a hash.
HGET key field: Get the value of a field in a hash.
HDEL key field: Delete one or more fields from a hash.
HGETALL key: Get all fields and values in a hash.
HMSET key field1 value1 field2 value2 ...: Set multiple fields in a hash.
HMGET key field1 field2 ...: Get the values of multiple fields in a hash.
HEXISTS key field: Check if a field exists in a hash.
HINCRBY key field increment: Increment a field's integer value.
HLEN key: Get the number of fields in a hash.
HKEYS key: Get all field names in a hash.
HVALS key: Get all values in a hash.

3. List Operations
Lists are ordered sequences of strings, supporting operations on both ends.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LPUSH key value: Prepend a value to the beginning of a list.
RPUSH key value: Append a value to the end of a list.
LPOP key: Remove and return the first element of a list.
RPOP key: Remove and return the last element of a list.
LRANGE key start stop: Get a range of elements from a list.
LLEN key: Get the length of a list.
LINDEX key index: Get the element at a specific index.
LSET key index value: Set the value of an element at a specific index.
LTRIM key start stop: Trim a list to keep only elements within a specified range.
RPOPLPUSH source destination: Remove the last element of the source list and push it to the beginning of the destination list.

4. Set Operations
Sets are unordered collections of unique strings.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SADD key member: Add a member to a set.
SREM key member: Remove a member from a set.
SISMEMBER key member: Check if a member exists in a set.
SMEMBERS key: Get all members in a set.
SCARD key: Get the number of members in a set.
SPOP key [count]: Remove and return one or more random members from a set.
SRANDMEMBER key [count]: Get one or more random members from a set.
SDIFF key1 key2 ...: Subtract multiple sets.
SINTER key1 key2 ...: Intersect multiple sets.
SUNION key1 key2 ...: Unite multiple sets.

5. Sorted Set (ZSet) Operations
Sorted Sets store unique strings, ordered by a score.
--------------------------------------------------------------

ZADD key score member: Add a member with a score to a sorted set.
ZRANGE key start stop: Get a range of members in a sorted set by index.
ZRANGEBYSCORE key min max: Get members within a score range.
ZREM key member: Remove a member from a sorted set.
ZSCORE key member: Get the score of a member in a sorted set.
ZINCRBY key increment member: Increment the score of a member in a sorted set.
ZCARD key: Get the number of members in a sorted set.
ZCOUNT key min max: Count the number of members in a score range.

6. Key Management Operations
These commands apply to all key types.
-----------------------------------------------------------
DEL key: Delete a key.
EXISTS key: Check if a key exists.
RENAME key newkey: Rename a key.
EXPIRE key seconds: Set a keyâ€™s expiration in seconds.
TTL key: Get the time-to-live of a key.
TYPE key: Get the data type of a key.
KEYS pattern: List all keys matching a pattern (e.g., KEYS user:*).
FLUSHALL: Remove all keys from all databases.
FLUSHDB: Remove all keys from the current database.

7. Transaction Operations
Transactions allow multiple commands to be executed atomically.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
MULTI: Start a transaction.
EXEC: Execute all commands in the transaction.
DISCARD: Discard all commands in the transaction.
WATCH key: Watch a key for changes before executing a transaction.
UNWATCH: Unwatch all watched keys.

8. Scripting Operations
Redis supports Lua scripting for complex operations.
------------------------------------------------------------------

EVAL script numkeys key [key ...] arg [arg ...]: Run a Lua script.
EVALSHA sha1 numkeys key [key ...] arg [arg ...]: Execute a cached script.

9. Pub/Sub Operations
Redis supports publish/subscribe messaging.
--------------------------------------------------

PUBLISH channel message: Publish a message to a channel.
SUBSCRIBE channel: Subscribe to a channel.
UNSUBSCRIBE channel: Unsubscribe from a channel.
PSUBSCRIBE pattern: Subscribe to channels matching a pattern.
PUNSUBSCRIBE pattern: Unsubscribe from channels matching a pattern.

10. Server Management Operations
Useful commands for managing Redis server settings and monitoring.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

INFO: Get information and statistics about the server.
CONFIG GET parameter: Get the configuration parameter.
CONFIG SET parameter value: Set the configuration parameter.
MONITOR: Monitor all commands received by the server.
CLIENT LIST: List connected clients.
CLIENT KILL ip:port: Disconnect a client by address.
SLOWLOG GET [n]: Get the Redis slow query log.

Examples
Setting and Getting Strings:
--------------------------

SET mykey "Hello, World!"
GET mykey

Working with Hashes:
-----------------------------
HSET myhash field1 "value1" field2 "value2"
HGETALL myhash
-
Working with Lists:
---------------------------
LPUSH mylist "one"
RPUSH mylist "two"
LRANGE mylist 0 -1
